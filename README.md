# Breast Cancer Detection Using ML and DL Algorithms

**Enhancing Breast Cancer Detection through Dimension Reduction and Data Sampling Techniques**


##  Introduction

Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern, particularly among women. Early detection is crucial to improving survival rates and treatment outcomes. This project presents a comprehensive approach to breast cancer detection using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. Specifically, we explore and compare the performance of:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks

The objective is to develop an accurate and robust binary classification model to identify cancerous cases while addressing challenges like high dimensionality and class imbalance.

- **Class Imbalance Handling**  
  Apply Random Under-Sampling (RUS) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to improve model performance on imbalanced data.

- **Performance Evaluation**  
  Analyze the classifiers based on key metrics such as **Accuracy** and **F-score** to determine the most effective model.
